assumptions
-returning an array of strings is acceptable
-there are no line breaks. i.e. one line bre-, next line ak. 
-i am assuming if there is an ending punctuation mark, there is nothing immediately after it. 
-this list will catch the punctuation marks: ['.', ',', '!', ';', ':', "'", '"', '(', ')', '{', '}', '[', ']']


todo

end of line /n
more arguments/files
test file if possible.
how to run program
see if you can console.log the return. like this console.log(mostCommonThreeWords('./morestuff.txt'))

more time
perhaps try a different language and library
structured differently. right now it iterates twice through the book essentialy. I had a challenge with counting line to line.
